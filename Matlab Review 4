function [A] = specialMatrix(n,m)
% This function should return a matrix A as described in the problem statement
% Inputs n is the number of rows, and m the number of columns
% It is recomended to first create the matrxix A of the correct size, filling it with zeros to start with is not a bad choice
switch nargin
    case 0
        error ('Please enter the number of rows and columns')
    case 1 
        error ('Please enter the number of columns')

end
 A = zeros (n,m)
[numRows, numcolumns]=size(A) 
g=1:numRows 
h=1:numcolumns
 for g=1:numRows;
     A(g,1)=g
 end
 for h=1:numcolumns
     A(1,h)=h
 end
 for g=1: numRows
     for h=1: numcolumns
         if g>1 && h>1
             A(g, h)=(A(g,(h-1))+A((g- 1),h))
         end
     end
% Now the real challenge is to fill in the correct values of A

% Things beyond here are outside of your function
% Here is a test call of your fuction. Feel free to play around with testing in here and change anything you like
% The grading tests are not impacted by code in this section, and may test different cases than are given in the example here.
%   If you want to use this in matlab directly (i.e. not online), you must save your function as a file specialMatrix.m
%   and then can save this script as anything you like, say specialMatrixTest.m for example.
n = 4; m = 5;
